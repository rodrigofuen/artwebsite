 Hi, my name is Rodrigo Fuentes. I'm a Mexican-American artist, born and raised in Miami, FL. My work delves into the complexities of identity and culture. Through a diverse range of mediums, I capture the nuances of life’s journey. At the heart of my practice is a deep exploration of what it means to exist in a multicultural world. My art is not only an exploration of my own identity, but also an invitation for others to examine their own perceptions of self and the ways in which culture, history, and personal experience shape our understanding of life. In every piece, I seek to challenge the viewer to reconsider their place in the world, sparking conversation about the intersection of culture, memory, and the ongoing evolution of identity. My work is an ongoing exploration of life’s complexities, with each piece serving as a reflection of the stories that make us who we are. Whether through abstract representations of emotion or figurative depictions of human experience, my art invites you to see the world through a lens that is both deeply personal and universally resonant.
